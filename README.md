# Rick and Morty Content

In the home page of our application, we want to see a list of all the locations, you can get them here

When you click over the location, without changing our current URL, we should be able to see all the characters dead or alive for that specific location.

Remember it's important to show the images and some brief information for each character.

When you click on one of the character names you should be redirected to the character page. Here we are going to show as much information we can get for each character
